The Story of Peter and the Wolf

Early one morning, Peter opened the gate and
walked out into the big green meadow.
On a branch of a big tree sat a little
bird, Peter's friend. "All is quiet"
chirped the bird happily.
Just then a
duck came waddling
round. She was glad that
Peter had not closed the
gate and decided to take a
nice swim in the deep
pond in the meadow.
Seeing the duck, the little bird flew down upon
on the grass, settled next to her and shrugged
his shoulders. "What kind of bird are you if
you can't fly?" said he. To this the duck replied
"What kind of bird are you if you can't swim?"
and dived into the pond.
They argued and argued, the duck swimming
in the pond and the little bird hopping along
the shore.
